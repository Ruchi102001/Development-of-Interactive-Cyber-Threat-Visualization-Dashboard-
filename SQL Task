1. Introduction to SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with relational databases. It allows users to:

Create and structure data

Insert and modify records

Retrieve meaningful information

Maintain security and performance

Although different database systems exist (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server), the core SQL syntax remains largely the same.

2. Creating Structured Data – CREATE TABLE, PRIMARY KEY, INSERT

To store data in a structured way, we must first define a table schema and then insert records.

Code Example
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')
cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    major TEXT
)
''')

cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, major) VALUES ('Alice', 'Computer Science')")
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO students (name, major) VALUES ('Bob', 'Mathematics')")

connection.commit()

cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM students")
print(cursor.fetchall())

connection.close()

Why These Statements Are Required

CREATE TABLE – Defines the structure (schema) of data before storing anything

PRIMARY KEY – Ensures each record is unique and identifiable

INSERT – Adds actual data into the table

3. Retrieving Data – SELECT, WHERE, DISTINCT, ORDER BY, LIMIT

These clauses help extract only the required information from large datasets.

Example
SELECT name, gpa FROM students;

SELECT * FROM students WHERE major = 'Computer Science';

SELECT DISTINCT major FROM students;

SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY gpa DESC;

SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY gpa DESC LIMIT 3;

Importance

SELECT – Chooses specific columns

WHERE – Filters records

DISTINCT – Removes duplicates

ORDER BY – Sorts results

LIMIT – Controls output size

4. Modifying Data – UPDATE & DELETE
UPDATE students SET major = 'Data Science' WHERE name = 'Alice';

DELETE FROM students WHERE name = 'Bob';

Caution

Without WHERE, all rows can be updated or deleted

Always verify with SELECT before executing changes

Changes are often irreversible without backup

5. Aggregation – COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP BY, HAVING
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(amount) FROM sales;

SELECT product_category, SUM(amount)
FROM sales GROUP BY product_category;

SELECT product_category, SUM(amount)
FROM sales GROUP BY product_category
HAVING SUM(amount) > 500;

Use

Business reports

Data analysis

Performance comparison

Trend identification

6. SQL Joins
Types of Joins

INNER JOIN – Only matching records

LEFT JOIN – All left + matches

RIGHT JOIN – All right + matches

FULL OUTER JOIN – Everything

CROSS JOIN – All combinations

SELF JOIN – Table joined with itself

SELECT name, order_id
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.cust_id;

7. Advanced Concepts – INDEX, VIEW, TRANSACTION
INDEX – Performance Optimization
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

VIEW – Security & Simplicity
CREATE VIEW public_user_balances AS
SELECT name, balance FROM users;

TRANSACTION – Data Consistency
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

UPDATE users SET balance = balance - 30 WHERE name = 'Alice';
UPDATE users SET balance = balance + 30 WHERE name = 'Bob';

COMMIT;

8. Learning Outcome

Through this project I learned:

How relational databases store structured data

Writing efficient SQL queries

Data filtering and analysis

Importance of constraints and transactions

Real-world use of Joins and Views

9. Conclusion

SQL is essential for managing and analyzing structured data in almost every software system. This project demonstrates practical understanding of:

Database creation

Data manipulation

Query optimization

Secure and reliable transactions

This knowledge can be applied to real-world domains such as e-commerce, banking, education, and analytics.
